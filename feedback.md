| | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| **Model Implementation** | Well-defined model value and code. | 20/20 |
| **Direct Manipulation Implementation** | Appropriate direct manipulation implementation with awesome feedback, although it took a bit of experimentation to realize that the drag needs to pause slightly before it “takes.” (–1) | 19/20 |
| **Notification Mechanism** | Notification mechanism relies on `textField` so no additional notification code is needed; however this should still be shown as functional in the demo to show that you meant to rely on it. (–3) | 17/20 |
| **Front End Integration** | Successful integration without component code modification, although integration approach is a little janky—black box reading/writing of text field value. Full component-level integration would have `@IBAction`s listening for changes to the Scrabble keyboard’s text field. (–3) | 17/20 |
| **Inappropriate Third-Party Library Use** | Complies with non-use of third-party libraries. Thank you for giving credit to resources that helped you. |  |
| **Test Suite** | 5 successes out of 5 total<br><br>**Statements** / (97.30%)<br>**Branches** / (88.10%)<br>**Functions** / (n/a)<br>**Lines** / (n/a)<br><br>(additional coverage from _ScrabbleKey.swift_) Good test count, high coverage; no notiification-checking tests (–3). | 17/20 |
| **Linting** | No significant linter errors. |  |
| **Version Control** | Sufficient commit granularity with understandable messages. |  |
| **Punctuality** | First commit on 11/21 1:49pm; last commit on 12/13 1:51pm |  |
|  | **Total** | **90/100** |
